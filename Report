ETL Project – Group 4: Joting Wong, Laura Hawkins, Hayden Buss, Gregory Pevey
1.      Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
·        The Happiness data is from Kaggle and the GDP data is from the IMF website
·        Both are in CSV format
2.      Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
·        Dropped columns to only the ones we need on both datasets
·        Renamed the columns
·        Rounded the decimals down to 2
·        On the govt_data table, we had to do a DropNA to remove the rows missing data (only 3 rows dropped)
3.      Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
·        Used PostgreSQL as a relational database
·        Created two tables: happy_data and govt_data
·        Joined the two tables at the end to have one single dataset
